    <div class="p1">Richmond, VA is a beautiful city. Underneath that beauty lies dark history with eerie locales that 
      will provide your spine with an unlimited supply of shivers.</div>
        
    <div class="p2">On this virtual tour, we'll stop at a few of the more infamous spots and discuss the grisly details that await. If you're ready, proceed on with
      caution as we take a stroll through one of Richmond's most beautiful, iconic, and sadly disturbing locations:
      </div>

    <div class="HC">Hollywood Cemetery</div>  
    <img class="hcwelcome" src="images/R.jpg">

    <p>High above the banks of the James River sits Hollywood Cemetery, a scrawling and hauntingly beautiful burial ground
      on 135 acres. In its hallowed ground lie 18,000 Confederate soldiers, 11,000 of whom are unknown. The cemetery is 
      also home to James Monroe and John Tyler (both were US persidents) and Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederacy
      during the Civil War. This is also the burial place of 22 Confederate generals, two Supreme Court Justices, and six Virginia 
      governors.
    </p>

    <p>
      Taking its name from the large number of holly trees growing throught the grounds, Hollywood Cemetery is 
      a beautiful natural haven and a place of peace and reflextion with breathtaking views over the James river.
    </p>

    <p>But let's not get carried away with beauty and splendor, for this sacred space is also home to eerie 
      tales and several local legends that are <em>guaranteed</em> to creep under your skin.
    </p>

    <img class="wwpoole" src="images\dcc77e8b94912948ef21c919fdd7735a.jpg">

    <p>Pictured on the left is the tomb of W.W. Pool, which is actually quite unremarkable in a cemetery filled with similar
      tombs.  What makes this one special is what was seen disappearing into the tomb...</p>

    <p>The date was October 2nd, 1925, and C&O locomotive #231 was passing through the Church Hill Tunnel, driven
      by engineer Tom Mason.  The tunnel had been plaugued with various problems and a previous cave-in due to the soft clay soil, so there were
      workers constantly inside. Tom Mason's train that day consisted of 10 flatcars, and as he began to move
      the locomtive from inside the tunnel, a few bricks from overhead fell down on to the tracks. Soon, the whole 
      tunnel began to collapse, with 100 feet of debris crashing down on Mason and many of the workmen who became
      trapped inside.</p>

    <p>Pictured below-right is the sealed tunnel as it appears today in Church Hill.</p>

    <img class="tunnel" src="images\RichmondChurchHillTunnelWest.webp"> 
   
    <p>Shortly after the disaster, a man emerged from the tunnel:</p>

    <p><em>“Covered in blood, with jagged teeth visible and with flesh hanging from its body, this figure, 
      barely recognizable as a human person, raced toward the James River...people tried to chase after 
      the figure but it quickly took refuge in and disappeared into Hollywood Cemetery. It disappeared 
      at the point where a mausoleum is located on the cemetery grounds. The creature vanished where the 
      mausoleum is built into the hillside of Hollywood Cemetery. The name displayed in that location is 
      that of W.W. Pool.”</em></p>

      <p>And thus was created the urban legend of The Richmond Vampire.</p>

      <p>Now, let us move on, shall we, just uphill from Mr. Pool's resting place to the grave of little Florence Rees.</p>

      <p>Florence died in 1862 at the age of two from Scarlett Fever, a sadly common ailment in the 19th
        century. Her unusual gravesite is pictured below, complete with a life-sized, black, cast-iron 
        Newfoundland dog statue standing guard.
      </p>

      <img class="dog" src="images\dog.jpg">

      <p>One explaination for the statue is found in the story of an anonymous storekeeper who gave the 
        dog to Mr. and Mrs. Rees in honor of Florence, because she admired the dog at his shop on Main Street.
        Those who get close to the statue sometimes report hearing random barking, and those who lean in a 
        little too closely report hearing disembodied growling.  If that isn't creepy enough, some folks
        have reported seeing the dog facing the opposite direction, perhaps to protect little Florence beneath.
      </p>

      <p>Hollywood Cemetery is a <em>MUST SEE</em> stop on any tour of Richmond, and is a great place for 
      locals to experience some of the best views of the city. The gates are open to visitors 7 days a week, 
      from 8:00 am to 5:00 pm (6:00 pm during Daylight Savings Time). You can walk, drive, or even set up 
      a Segway tour by visiting the <a href="https://www.hollywoodcemetery.org/visit/tour-options">cemetery's 
      website</a>. The cemetery is especially beautiful in the autumn, when ghosts and vampires come out to play.</p>

      <p>Now, let's proceed just two miles northwest to one of Richmond's most hip shopping areas to visit the 
        iconic Byrd Theater.
