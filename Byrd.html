        <p>The Byrd Theater, located in Carytown, is reported to be the one of the most haunted buildings in 
            Richmond. Opened in 1928, this movie-only theater features the "Mighty Wurlitzer" organ, originally
            designed to accompany silent films.
        </p>

        <p>One theater manager said there are at least two ghosts inhabiting the building.
            One is a little girl who has often been seem playing in the women's bathroom.  The other is the
            spirit of the former manager, Mr. Coulter, who worked at the theater between 1928 and 1971. He has
            been seen all over the theater, but is most often seen haunting the balcony section. The Byrd is another
            <em>must visit</em> Richmond location, nestled in the center of the very "hip" Carytown shopping
            district. For more info on the Byrd, check out their <a href="https://www.hollywoodcemetery.org/visit/tour-options">official website.</a>
            Now, let's head back towards Hollywood Cemetery and take a stop in Byrd Park at the infamous and very
            haunted Byrd Park Pump House.</p>
