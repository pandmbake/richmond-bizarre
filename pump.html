      <p>The Byrd Park Pump House has an interesting and strange history. It was built in the late 19th
        century in a Gothic revival style, and contained the city's main waterworks from 1883 to 1924.
        Water was drawn directly from the James River and Kanawha Canal and pumped uphill to the Byrd
        Park Reservoir, which was Richmond's primary water supply.</p>

      <p>The pump house was also a favorite place for parties.  It was used as a social venue for 
          dances, where well-dressed Richmonders boarded a flat-bottomed boat at 7th Street for a 
          relaxing cruise up the canal to the ballroom.</p>

      <p>The building closed in 1924, and had its pumps sold for scrap metal before the start of the Second
          World War. The city scheduled the pump house for demolition, but sold it to First Presbyterian 
          Church for one dollar.</p>

      <p>The pump house is filled with echoes of the past, including several spine-tingling haunts.
          One is the ghost of Daniel Tetweiler, a man who reportedly hung himself inside. Another is
          the apparition of "Elizabeth," who is seen floating around the premises as a glowing orb of
          light. One paranormal investigator, Robert Bess, says the pump house is "exteremely haunted."
          He thinks the place is actually a portal; elements of the building's composition mix to create
          a conductor through which paranormal activity can enter our reality. There is moving water,
          steel, a roof made of slate, and iron all through the structure.</p> 
          
      <p>The idea of portals may seem a bit "out there," but there is no doubt that the pump house 
          has a facinating history and is an extremely creepy location, one that is a required stop on 
          any tour of Richmond. The city is currently 
          attempting to revive the structure. You can visit the <a href="https://jamesriverpark.org/project/pumphouse-park"> 
          pump house official website</a> for directions and more info.</p>

      <p>Just up the hill from the pump house, and still in Byrd Park, you can find the famous
         Richmond Carillon. Although I'm not aware of any well-known creepy stories surrounding
         this beautiful structure, below is a wonderfully-told true story called "White Lady" from Lynwood Cox, 
         a local Richmond native who experienced something unusual there.</p>

      <p>Thanks for coming along on this spooky tour of Richmond.  I hope you will go out explore these locations on your own,
         or better yet, go with a friend for backup in case you actually encounter something "otherworldly."</p>
